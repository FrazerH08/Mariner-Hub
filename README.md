For the Final Major project I am going to develop a modern website where Grimsby Town fans as a community can interact and chat with each other. They will be many more features on the website where fans can gather information , the website will include stats from the team and many more , posts from admins will be viewable for everyone. The users should enjoy a nice experience without being frustrated and they should be able to access all features. I want this website to be able to be viewable on a desktop/laptop and a phone![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c64e92a-747e-40c9-99c2-a6bdb81c8558)

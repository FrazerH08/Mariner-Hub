        After the Second World War had finished Grimsby never returned back to the top level it once was despite the appointment of Bill Shankly who famously took liverpool to title glory , winning divison 1 , FA Cup and EUEFA cup eith liverppol. <br>
        <br> Shankly was a successful manager for the mariners despite never getting them back to the level they once was, he resigned due to the lack of ambition on the board.
        <br> Grimsby Town were the first ever club to appoint a foreign manager with the appointment of Hungarian Elem√©r Berkessy.
        <br> After even more downfall finally in 1972 Grimsby Town were promoted to division three , with the clubs turnaround was credited to the appointment of Lawrie Mcmenemy <br>

        <br> In the 1983-84 season Grimsby finished 5th in the Second division which was the clubs highest ever league finish since 1948. 

        <br> Alan Buckley was appointed in 1988 and by 1991 the club had two successive promotions back to division 2 , Grimsby remained in the second flight for 6 years. Alan Buckley left the club to become the manager at West Bromwich Albion.
        <br> The 1997-98 Season saw the return of Alan Buckley as manager who was described as the clubs best ever manager , with the club getting to the Football League Trophy final at Wembley with a golden goal finish in the 112th minute saw Grimsby lift the trophy. <br>
        4 weeks later Grimsby was back at wembley this time against Northampton Town in the Division Two Playoff Final Grimsby won this game 1-0 to seal promotion back to Division one.

        <br> Alan Buckley again returned to the Mariners and took them to the Football League Trophy Final Again but Grimsby lost on this occasion losing 2-0 MK dons , Buckley left not long after that and the club was relegated out of the Football league in 2010 for the first time in nearly 100 years.<br>
        <br> Grimsby Would have multiple failed playoff campaigns and in 2014-15 they got to Wembley for the playoff final but unfortunately lost on penalties to Bristol Rovers , but one season later grimsby would get promoted in the playoff final against Forest Green Rovers beating them 3-1 <br>
        <br> The mariners returned to the football league after a 6 year absence  , but manager Paul Hurst who delivered success decided to leave to join Shrewsbury. The mariners would survive near misses but in the 2020-21 season heavily affected by COVID-19 meaning games were behind closed doors , The mariners got relegated back to the National League , Paul Hurst came back in December 2020 but he could not prevent the Mariners relegation. <br>
